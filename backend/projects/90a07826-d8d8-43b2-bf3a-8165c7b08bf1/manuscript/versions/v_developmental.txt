The Sweater 
Surprise

T he morning sun streamed through the living room window, painting gold-

en stripes across the soft carpet. Angel Baby stretched her tiny black paws 

forward, her curly tail wiggling with pure happiness. At just one year old, she was 

the perfect size for a pug—round, wrinkly, and absolutely adorable.

"Good morning, mi angelita!" Mommy Silvia sang out from the kitchen. The 

sweet smell of coffee drifted through the air, mixing with the scent of cinnamon 

toast.

Angel Baby's Lat little nose twitched. Her big brown eyes sparkled as she 

trotted toward the sound of Mommy's voice, her paws making soft *pat-pat-pat* 

sounds on the hardwood floor.

"?ook who's awake!" Susana giggled, setting down her backpack near the front 

door. She crouched down and scratched behind Angel Baby's velvety ears. "Eeady 

for breakfast, little sisterO"

*Snort, snort!* Angel Baby's whole body wiggled with e'citement. Breakfast 

was one of her favorite times of day—well, every mealtime was her favorite, really.

Silvia appeared with Angel Baby's special bowl, decorated with tiny bone 

patterns around the rim. She set it down gently on the kitchen mat. "Here you 

go, baby. Eat up!"

Angel Baby dove in, munching happily. The kibble crunched between her 

teeth—*crunch, crunch, crunch*—the most delicious sound in the world.

After breakfast came playtime. Angel Baby grabbed her favorite squeaky toy, 

a bright blue elephant with Loppy ears, and shook it back and forth. *Squeak! 

Squeak! Squeak!* She pranced around the living room, showing ox her prize to 

anyone who would watch.

":ou're so silly!" Susana laughed, tying her shoes for school. "W wish W could stay 

and play with you all day."

But Susana had to leave for school, and Mommy Silvia had work to do at her 

desk in the corner. That was okay with Angel Baby. She had her own important 

business to attend to.

She trotted over to her special spot—the sunny patch by the big window where 

the warmth pooled like liIuid gold on the carpet. The sun had climbed higher 

now, making the spot e'tra toasty. Angel Baby circled once, twice, three times, 

then plopped down with a satisPed *oomph*.

The warmth soaked into her black fur like a cozy blanket. She could see the 

whole neighborhood from hereC leaves tumbling across the yard in shades of 

orange and red, a sIuirrel racing up the oak tree, birds hopping along the fence.

Angel Baby's eyes grew heavy. Her breathing slowed to a gentle rhythm—in 

and out, in and out. Her tiny body rose and fell peacefully.

"?ook at her," Silvia whispered into her phone, probably talking to Grandma 

again. "She's so precious when she sleeps. :es, yes, she's my little angel..."

Time passed in the most wonderful way—with dreams of treats and belly rubs 

and endless squeaky toys. Angel Baby's paws twitched as she dreamed of chasing 

butterLies through Pelds of Lowers.

Dhen she Pnally woke up, the sun had shifted. The air felt dixerent some-

how—cooler, crisper. Angel Baby yawned, showing all her tiny teeth, and 

stretched again.

Mommy Silvia was moving around the living room now, humming a cheerful 

tune. She had that sparkle in her eyes, the one that usually meant something 

exciting was about to happen.

"Angel Baby," Silvia called sweetly, reaching for a colorful shopping bag on the 

couch. "Mommy has a surprise for you!"

Angel Baby's ears perked up. Surprises usually meant treats or new toys. Her 

tail started to wag as she trotted over, her whole body full of hope and curiosity.

But as Silvia reached into the bag and pulled out something soft and pink, 

Angel Baby's wagging slowed. That didn't look like a treat. That didn't look like 

a toy.

That looked like... *clothes*.

The front door swung open with a cheerful jingle of keys, and Angel Baby's 

ears perked up from her favorite spot on the living room rug. Mommy Silvia 

stepped inside, her cheeks Lushed pink from the cold autumn air, carrying a 

bright shopping bag that crinkled with promise.

"Girls! 4ome see what W found!" Silvia's voice bubbled with e'citement as she 

kicked ox her shoes and hurried into the living room.

Angel Baby's curly tail wagged cautiously. Shopping bags usually meant one of 

two thingsC delicious treats or... something else. She trotted closer, her little black 

nose twitching as she investigated.

Susana looked up from her coloring book, her eyes lighting up. "Dhat is it, 

MommyO"

Silvia knelt down on the soft carpet, setting the bag between them. The after-

noon sunlight streaming through the window caught the shimmer of tissue paper 

as she reached inside. Dith a Lourish, she pulled out a bundle of soft fabric and 

held it up.

"Ta-da! ?ook at this adorable sweater W found for Angel Baby!"

The sweater unfurled like a tiny banner of doom—at least, that's how Angel 

Baby saw it. Wt was undeniably beautifulC a cozy knit creation in shades of coral 

pink and cream, with delicate white buttons running down the back and a pre-

cious little collar. The fabric looked impossibly soft, the kind that begged to be 

touched.

"Uh, Mommy! Wt's so pretty!" Susana sIuealed, reaching out to feel the mate-

rial. "Wt's so fuzzy!"

F

Angel Baby took a small step backward, her dark eyes P'ed on the sweater. 

Wt looked suspiciously like the thing Mommy had tried to put on her last win-

ter—the thing that felt weird and restricting and made her feel like a stuxed toy 

instead of a proper pug.

Silvia held the sweater up to the light, admiring the craftsmanship. "W saw it 

in the window at that little boutiIue downtown, and W just couldn't resist. Wt's 

perfect for our holiday shopping trip this weekend!" She turned to Angel Baby 

with a warm smile. ":ou're going to look absolutely precious, mi amor."

Angel Baby's tail stopped wagging. Her whole body tensed as Silvia brought 

the sweater closer, letting her snix it. The fabric smelled new and slightly per-

fumed, nothing like her familiar blankets or the worn cushions she loved.

"SeeO Wt's so soft and warm," Silvia cooed, running her Pngers through the knit. 

"The lady at the store said it's made especially for little dogs. Wt won't be itchy at 


Susana scooted closer on her knees, her hands clasped together. "4an we try it 

on her nowO 3lease, please, pleaseO"

"Dell..." Silvia glanced at Angel Baby, who had now backed up another step, her 

e'pression shifting from curious to decidedly suspicious. "De should probably let 

her get used to seeing it Prst. Dhat do you think, Angel BabyO 5on't you want to 

stay nice and cozy when we go out in the coldO"

Angel Baby's answer was written clearly in her wrinkled little faceC absolutely 

not.

Silvia laughed softly, folding the sweater over her arm. "W know that look. But 

sweet girl, it's getting chilly outside. :ou'll need this to stay warm." She reached 

out to stroke Angel Baby's velvety head. "De're going to have such a wonderful 

time shopping together. :ou'll ride in your stroller, and everyone will say how 

beautiful you look."

The word "stroller" usually made Angel Baby's tail wag—she loved her stroller 

rides, watching the world go by from her cozy seat. But right now, all she could 

focus on was that sweater draped over Mommy's arm, waiting like a soft, colorful 

trap.

Susana giggled, noticing Angel Baby's wary stance. "W think she knows what's 

coming, Mommy."

"W think you're right," Silvia said with an amused smile. She stood up, sweater 

in hand, and walked toward the hallway. "?et me hang this up for now. De'll try 

it on after dinner."

As Silvia disappeared down the hall, Angel Baby remained frozen in place, 

staring after her. The sweater was in the house now. Wt was only a matter of time 

before the battle began.

The moment Silvia approached with the sweater held out in front of her, Angel 

Baby's dark eyes grew as round as the treats in her cookie jar.

"2o, no, no, no, no!" her little body seemed to say, though all that came out was 

a sharp snort.

Her stubby legs sprang into action, and she darted across the hardwood floor, 

her paws clicking frantically as she scrambled under the coffee table. There, in 

the shadowy safety beneath the wooden surface, Angel Baby pressed herself Lat 

against the cool floor—as Lat as a little black pug pancake.

"Angel Baby, sweetie, come out from there," Silvia cooed, kneeling down and 

peering into the dim space. The sweater dangled from her hand like a soft, pink 

threat.

Angel Baby scooted backward, her wrinkled face scrunched in determination. 

Her curly tail, usually perky and proud, tucked tight against her bottom.

"She looks like a fuzzy black rug!" Susana giggled, dropping to her hands and 

knees beside her mother. "Angel, it's just a sweater. Wt's so pretty! 5on't you want 

to look fancyO"

Angel Baby snorted again—a sound that clearly meant "absolutely not."

Silvia reached under the table, her Pngers wiggling encouragingly. "4ome on, 

my little love. De can't stay under here all day."

But Angel Baby had other plans. The moment Silvia's hand got close, she 

bolted to the right, sIueezing out from under the opposite side of the table with 

surprising speed for such a chunky pug. Her ears Lapped as she ran, and her 

breathing came in e'cited little huxs.

7

"She's heading for the couch!" Susana called out, scrambling to her feet.

Sure enough, Angel Baby dove behind the large gray sofa, wedging herself 

into the narrow space between the couch and the wall. The gap was barely wide 

enough for her round body, but somehow she managed to sIueeze in, disappear-

ing into the shadows like a furry little escape artist.

Silvia sighed, though a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. "Angel Baby, 

you're being very silly. Wt's just a sweater, mi amor."

8rom behind the couch came a mu*ed grunt of protest.

Susana peeked over the back of the sofa, trying to spot the stubborn pug. "W can 

see her little butt! Her tail is still sticking out!"

"Angel," Silvia said, her voice gentle but Prm as she walked around to the side 

of the couch. "De need to get ready for our special trip. :ou'll love the holiday 

lights and all the people who will want to pet you. But it's cold outside, baby girl. 

:ou need to stay warm."

Silence from behind the couch.

Then, slowly, a black wrinkled face emerged from the shadows, just enough for 

one suspicious eye to peek out at Silvia.

"There's my sweet girl," Silvia whispered, crouching down with the sweater 

folded in her lap. "W promise it won't be so bad. Vust try it on for MommyO"

Angel Baby's eye narrowed. Wn a Lash, she pulled back and shot out from the 

other end of the couch, her paws skittering on the floor as she made a break for 

the dining room.

"She's too fast!" Susana laughed, giving chase.

qnder the dining table Angel Baby went, weaving between the chair legs like an 

obstacle course champion. Her breathing was heavy now, her pink tongue lolling 

out the side of her mouth, but her determination never wavered.

Silvia followed more slowly, the sweater still in her hands. "Angel Baby, you're 

going to tire yourself out, sweetheart."

But Angel Baby was already on the move again. She emerged from under the 

dining table and made a dash for her favorite sunny spot by the window—only 

A2GN? BAB:HS S3N4WA? 5A:

to Pnd Susana had anticipated her move and was already standing there, arms 

outstretched.

"Gotcha!" Susana said with a grin.

Angel Baby skidded to a stop, her paws sliding slightly on the smooth floor. She 

looked left, then right, searching for another escape route. Her sides heaved with 

each breath, and a thin line of drool stretched from her mouth.

Silvia approached from behind, moving slowly and calmly. "Ukay, little one. 

Game over. Time to be a good girl."

Angel Baby spun around to face her, backing up until her bottom bumped 

against Susana's legs. She was trapped.

"Wt's okay, Angel," Susana said softly, kneeling down and gently stroking the 

pug's warm, soft head. "Mommy's not trying to hurt you. The sweater will keep 

you cozy."

Silvia knelt in front of Angel Baby, holding the sweater open. "Vust your head 

Prst, baby. That's all. Vust slip your little head through."

Angel Baby looked at the sweater, then at Silvia, then back at the sweater. 

Her whole body seemed to deLate with resignation, though her eyes still held a 

glimmer of stubborn protest.

As Silvia moved the sweater closer, Angel Baby began to wiggle—not to run 

this time, but to sIuirm and twist as if she could somehow make herself too 

slippery to dress. Her head ducked down, her shoulders hunched up, and she 

pulled her front legs in tight against her chest.

"Angel Baby, you're making this so much harder than it needs to be," Silvia said 

with a gentle laugh, trying to guide the sweater's neck hole over the pug's head.

Angel Baby's ears folded back, and she let out a long, dramatic groan that 

seemed to come from the very depths of her soul. As the soft fabric touched her 

head, she shook violently, as if trying to shake ox water after a bath.

"Rold still, sweetie," Silvia murmured, Pnally managing to get the sweater over 

Angel Baby's head. But getting her front legs through the arm holes proved to be 

an entirely dixerent challenge.

1

Angel Baby went completely rigid, her legs locked straight like little black posts. 

Dhen Silvia tried to bend one leg to guide it through an arm hole, Angel Baby 

pulled it back. Dhen Silvia tried the other leg, the same thing happened.

"She's like a little statue!" Susana observed, giggling at the pug's stix, unyielding 

posture.

"A very stubborn little statue," Silvia agreed, her patience tested but still hold-

ing strong.

After several minutes of gentle coa'ing, wiggling, and patient maneuvering, 

Silvia Pnally managed to get both of Angel Baby's front legs through the arm 

holes. She Iuickly pulled the sweater down over the pug's round body and ad-

justed it so it sat properly.

"There!" Silvia said triumphantly, sitting back on her heels. "All done! SeeO 

That wasn't so terrible, was itO"

Angel Baby stood perfectly still, as if moving might somehow make the situa-

tion worse. The pink sweater hugged her compact body, the soft fabric decorated 

with tiny white hearts. She looked down at herself, then up at Silvia with an 

e'pression of pure betrayal.

(ictory! Silvia held the wriggling black pug Prmly but gently, the pink sweater 

Pnally stretched over Angel Baby's head. "There we go, mi amor. Vust one little 

paw at a time."

Angel Baby twisted her body like a furry pretzel, her back legs kicking at the 

air as Silvia guided Prst one paw, then the other through the sweater's sleeves. The 

soft fabric settled across her small body, and Silvia adjusted the hem, making sure 

everything sat just right.

"3erfect!" Silvia clapped her hands together. "Uh, Angel Baby, you look so—"

The moment Silvia's hands released her, Angel Baby dropped to the hardwood 

floor like a fallen star. She rolled onto her back, all four paws pointed at the ceiling, 

wiggling frantically from side to side. Her curly tail thrashed as she rubbed her 

A2GN? BAB:HS S3N4WA? 5A:


back against the smooth wood, trying desperately to push the sweater up and over 

her head.

"Angel, no!" Silvia laughed, reaching down to right her.

But Angel Baby had already Lipped onto her belly. She backed up rapidly 

toward the coffee table, her bottom bumping against the wooden leg with a 

soft *thunk*. She pressed harder, hoping the furniture might somehow catch the 

sweater's edge and pull it ox.

*Thunk. Thunk. Thunk.*

"Susana, look at her!" Silvia giggled, covering her mouth.

Susana sat cross-legged on the couch, watching the show with wide eyes. "She 

really doesn't like it, Mommy."

Angel Baby abandoned the coffee table and tried a new approach. She planted 

her front paws Prmly on the floor and scooted her rear end backward across the 

room, dragging herself along like a tiny, disgruntled mop. The sweater, however, 

remained stubbornly in place.

8rustrated, she sat down with a heavy *plop*, her little chest heaving with 

the exort of her escape attempts. She looked up at Silvia with enormous dark 

eyes—eyes that seemed to grow larger and sadder with each passing second. Her 

bottom lip would have trembled if pugs could manage such a thing. Wnstead, she 

let out a long, mournful whimper that echoed through the living room.

"Uh, no you don't." Silvia knelt down, meeting those pleading eyes. "Those 

puppy-dog eyes won't work this time, Angel Baby."

Angel Baby's ears drooped. She tilted her head to one side, then the other, 

maintaining her sorrowful gaze. Another soft whine escaped her wrinkled muz-

zle.

Silvia's resolve wavered for just a moment. "W know it feels strange, sweet girl. 

But you'll get used to it, W promise."

Angel Baby remained frozen in place, sitting as still as a statue. Unly her eyes 

moved, tracking Silvia's every gesture. The pink sweater covered her round belly 

and sturdy back, the fabric rising and falling with each breath. She looked utterly 

defeated, a tiny prisoner in her cozy, soft jail.


EUBNET MU2EUN TqE2NE

Susana climbed down from the couch and approached carefully. "Maybe she 

needs a treat to feel betterO"

"2ice try, but Angel Baby needs to learn that sometimes we wear things we 

don't love." Silvia stroked the pug's head gently. "Besides, once we get to the 

holiday market and she sees all the wonderful sights, she'll forget all about her 

sweater."

At the word "market," Angel Baby's ears perked up slightly. She knew that 

word. Markets meant new smells, interesting people, and sometimes—if she was 

very lucky—dropped bits of food to investigate.

But still, the sweater felt wrong. Wt hugged her body in places nothing had 

hugged before. Wt made her feel trapped, conPned, unable to be her true, naked 

self.

She sat there on the living room floor, a picture of pure misery, waiting to see 

what would happen ne't.

Silvia lowered herself to the floor with a soft sigh, crossing her legs and patting 

the carpet beside her. Angel Baby, still half-hidden beneath the coffee table, 

watched her mommy with wary dark eyes.

"4ome here, mi amor," Silvia said gently, her voice as warm as hot chocolate on 

a winter morning.

Angel Baby's curly tail twitched. She inched forward just a little, her black 

paws sliding across the hardwood until she was close enough to snix Silvia's 

outstretched hand.

"W know you don't like the sweater," Silvia began, stroking the soft wrinkles on 

Angel Baby's forehead. "But let me tell you why it's so important today."

Susana settled onto the couch behind them, pulling her own jacket closer. 

Through the window, gray clouds hung low in the sky, and a cold wind rattled 

the windowpanes.

"Wt's getting very chilly outside," Silvia continued, gathering Angel Baby into 

her lap. The little pug didn't resist this time, though her body remained tense. 

"And today is special—we're going to the mall to see all the beautiful holiday 

decorations!"

A2GN? BAB:HS S3N4WA? 5A:


Angel Baby's ears perked up slightly at the e'citement in Silvia's voice.

"There will be giant 4hristmas trees with sparkling lights," Silvia said, her eyes 

brightening as she painted the picture. "And music playing, and so many people 

who will want to say hello to the cutest pug they've ever seen." She booped Angel 

Baby's nose playfully.

"And the pet store!" Susana added from the couch. "Eemember how much you 

love visiting the pet store, AngelO"

Angel Baby's tail gave a small wag at that. The pet store meant treats, and new 

smells, and sometimes even other dogs to snix through the glass.

Silvia cupped Angel Baby's wrinkled face in both hands, looking directly into 

those round, e'pressive eyes. "But here's the thing, baby girl. Wt's too cold for 

you outside without protection. :our little body isn't made for this weather. The 

sweater isn't to make you uncomfortable—it's to keep you safe and warm so you 

can enjoy all these wonderful things with us."

Angel Baby let out a small whimper, but it was softer now, less insistent.

"W would never let anything hurt you," Silvia whispered, pressing a kiss to the 

top of Angel Baby's velvety head. "The sweater is like a hug from me, even when 

we're walking through the cold. Wt means W'm taking care of you."

The living room fell Iuiet e'cept for the ticking of the wall clock and the distant 

hum of tra(cid:74)c outside. Angel Baby leaned into Silvia's chest, feeling the steady 

rhythm of her heartbeat.

"So what do you sayO" Silvia asked softly. "4an we try one more timeO 8or our 

special adventureO"

Angel Baby looked up at her mommy's kind face, then over at Susana, who was 

smiling hopefully. She glanced at the red sweater still lying on the couch, looking 

somehow less threatening now.

Dith a resigned little grunt, Angel Baby licked Silvia's chin—her way of saying 

okay.

"That's my brave girl!" Silvia beamed, reaching for the sweater once more. 

"2ow, let's do this together. 2ice and slow."

This time, when Silvia held up the sweater, Angel Baby didn't run.

00Scene 7C Silvia lifts Angel Baby (cid:75)still wearing the sweater(cid:76) into her special 

stroller00

Silvia bent down and scooped Angel Baby into her arms, sweater and all. 

"4ome on, my little grump. Wnto your chariot we go!"

Angel Baby's dark eyes widened as she realized what was happening. The 

stroller. Her beloved pink-and-white stroller with the cushioned seat and the clear 

dome cover that let her see everything during their walks. Any other day, she 

would have wagged her curly tail with joy at the sight of it waiting by the front 

door.

But todayO Today she was trapped in this itchy, conPning sweater.

"There we go, sweet girl." Silvia gently lowered her into the stroller's cozy 

interior. Angel Baby settled onto the familiar cushion with a resigned hux, her 

little body stix with protest. She lifted one paw and scratched at the sweater's 

neckline, trying once more to wiggle free.

"Susana, honey, can you grab the reusable shopping bags from the kitchenO" 

Silvia called over her shoulder as she adjusted the stroller's safety strap around 

Angel Baby's middle.

"Got them!" Susana appeared moments later, her arms full of colorful tote 

bags. Her eyes sparkled with e'citement. "Are we really going to the holiday 

market downtownO The one with all the lightsO"

"De sure are." Silvia smiled, reaching for her coat from the rack by the door. 

"And then maybe hot chocolate afterward."

Susana did a little hop of delight and began pulling on her own jacket—a 

puxy red one with white snowLakes. "Angel Baby's going to love seeing all the 

decorations!"

Angel Baby tilted her head, her velvety ears perking up slightly at the enthusi-

asm in Susana's voice. She watched as her sister zipped up her coat and wrapped a 

striped scarf around her neck. Through the window beside the door, Angel Baby 

could see gray clouds hanging low in the sky, and the bare tree branches swaying 

in the wind.

A2GN? BAB:HS S3N4WA? 5A:


Wt did look cold out there.

Silvia knelt beside the stroller, her face level with Angel Baby's. "W know you 

don't like your new sweater, baby girl," she said softly, running a gentle Pnger 

along Angel Baby's wrinkled forehead. "But Mommy needs you to stay warm and 

healthy. De're going to have so much fun together—just wait and see."

Angel Baby stared at her mommy with those big, soulful eyes. She gave another 

e'perimental tug at the sweater with her paw, but it didn't budge.

"EeadyO" Silvia stood and gripped the stroller handle.

"Eeady!" Susana positioned herself by the door, her hand on the knob.

As Susana pulled the door open, a gust of chilly 2ovember air rushed into the 

entryway, making Angel Baby's whiskers twitch. She felt the cold breeze ru*e the 

fur on her face—the only part of her not covered by the dreaded sweater.

And then, for just a moment, she noticed something. The parts of her body 

wrapped in the soft red fabric felt... not cold. Actually, they felt kind of... okay.

She wouldn't admit it, of course. She maintained her most skeptical e'pression 

as Silvia pushed the stroller forward, its wheels gliding smoothly over the thresh-

old.

"Here we go, Angel Baby!" Susana sang out, skipping ahead down the front 

path. "Adventure time!"

Angel Baby sat very still in her stroller, the sweater snug around her small body, 

as her family stepped out into the crisp afternoon. The door clicked shut behind 

them, and the holiday shopping trip began.

5espite everything, Angel Baby's nose twitched with curiosity. Dhat adven-

tures awaited on this mysterious outingO She supposed—just maybe—she would 

have to wait and see.

Nven if she had to do it while wearing a sweater.

Winter 
Wonderland 
Discovery

T he automatic doors whooshed open, and a gust of cold air swept across 

Angel Baby's face. She blinked, her little nose twitching at the sudden 

change from the warm, crowded mall to the fresh winter world beyond.

"Oh my!" Mommy Silvia pulled her scarf a bit tighter. "It's gotten colder. Good 

thing we got that sweater just in time."

Angel Baby barely heard her. She sat in her stroller, staring at the scene before 

her with wide, wondering eyes.

The outdoor holiday market stretched out like something from a storybook. 

Wooden stalls with peaked roofs lined both sides of a cobblestone path, each one 

draped with evergreen garlands and glowing with warm golden lights. Strings 

of twinkling bulbs crisscrossed overhead, creating a canopy of stars against the 

darkening winter sky. Soft snowLakes drifted down, catching the light as they fell, 

making everything shimmer with a light dusting of white.

"?ook at all the lights, Angel!" Susana crouched down beside the stroller, 

pointing toward the market. "Aren't they pretty-"

Angel Baby's curly tail began to wag slowly, then faster. The air smelled di—erx

ent out hereNsharp and clean, miEed with the sweet scent of roasting chestnuts 

AYGP? BABC'S SDP2IA? 7AC

and cinnamon. She could hear laughter echoing from somewhere deeper in the 

market, children's voices calling out in delight.

A group of kids ran past, their boots crunching in the light snow, their breath 

making little clouds in the air. They wore pu—y coats and colorful scarves, their 

cheeks glowing with eEcitement.

Mommy Silvia lifted Angel Baby from the stroller and set her gently on the 

pavement. Angel Baby stood perfectly still, her four paws planted Rrmly on the 

ground. The snowLakes tickled her nose, melting instantly on her warm black fur. 

But her bodyNher body felt perfectly comfortable. The red sweater with white 

snowLakes hugged her snugly, keeping the cold from seeping through to her skin.

"She's not shivering at all," Mommy Silvia observed with a smile, watching 

Angel Baby's curious eEploration. "The sweater is working perfectly."

Susana gently took Angel Baby's leash, giving it a soft tug. "2ome on, Angel. 

?et's go see what's in the market! There's so much to eEplore!"

Angel Baby looked up at her family, then back at the magical winter wonderx

land ahead. Uer heart beat a little faster with anticipation. Without 8uite underx

standing why, she felt something di—erent about being outside this timeNsomex

thing that made her want to eEplore rather than retreat to the warmth of Mommy 

Silvia's arms.

She took a deep breath of the crisp winter air and stepped forward, ready for 

adventure.

Angel Baby's paws touched the cobblestone pathway, and she felt the light 

dusting of snow beneath her feet. Tiny snowLakes drifted down from the 

grayxwhite sky, landing on her nose and making her blink.

"There you go, sweetheart," Mommy Silvia said, keeping a gentle hold on the 

leash. "?et's eEplore together."

Angel Baby took one cautious step forward, then another. The thin layer of 

snow was cool beneath her paws but not uncomfortable. She glanced back at 

Mommy Silvia and Susana, who smiled encouragingly.

"?ook at her go!" Susana clapped her mittened hands together. "She's being so 

brave!"

H9

Angel Baby paused near the Rrst stall, waiting for the familiar shiver that always 

came when she spent too long outside in winter. She remembered other cold days 

when her teeth would chatter after just a few minutes, when her little body would 

tremble until Mommy Silvia scooped her back into her warm coat.

But the shiver didn't come.

She stood still for a moment, surprised. The snow was cool under her paws, 

yes, and the winter wind brushed against her face, but her body felt snug and 

protected. The soft fabric of her sweater hugged her back and sides, keeping the 

cold air from reaching her skin.

"2ome on, Angel Baby!" Susana called, walking a few steps ahead. "?ook at all 

the pretty decorations!"

Angel Baby trotted forward with growing curiosity. She passed the stall selling 

handmade ornaments, their glass surfaces catching the light and throwing rainx

bow sparkles onto the snow. At the neEt stall, wreaths of evergreen hung from 

hooks, their pine scent strong and fresh.

A gust of wind swept through the market, and Angel Baby instinctively braced 

herself. But instead of the biting cold she eEpected, she felt only a gentle coolness 

on her face. Uer sweater held Rrm against the bree¡e, keeping her comfortable.

"She's not even shaking," Mommy Silvia observed, crouching down to pet 

Angel Baby's head. "Jsually by now, she'd be trying to climb back into my arms."

Angel Baby looked up at her mommy, then down at her own body wrapped in 

the red sweater with white snowLakes. The fabric felt soft against her fur, and for 

the Rrst time since putting it on, it didn't bother her 8uite as much.

A group of children ran past, laughing and calling to each other, their breath 

making little clouds in the cold air. They wore thick coats and colorful scarves, 

and they were having the time of their lives.

Qust like them, Angel Baby thought, I'm dressed for winter.

"Should we look at the toy stall-" Susana asked, pointing to a booth decorated 

with wooden trains and stu—ed animals deeper in the market.

AYGP? BABC'S SDP2IA? 7AC

Hé

Angel Baby's tail began to wagNslowly at Rrst, then faster. She took several 

8uick steps forward, her paws leaving tiny prints in the snow, a trail showing 

eEactly where her adventure was taking her.

As they continued walking, the pathway opened up and Angel Baby's paws 

moved with increasing conRdence beside Mommy Silvia through the festive 

market. The little pug stood taller now, noticing how comfortable she felt. Uer 

sweater hugged her snugly, keeping the winter chill away while the crisp air tickled 

her nose.

"?ook at you, mi amor!" Susana clapped her hands together. "Cou're walking 

around like a big girl!"

And she was! Angel Baby's tail wagged with growing eEcitement. The world 

looked so di—erent from down here instead of from her stroller. Pverything 

seemed bigger, brighter, more eEciting.

"2ome smell this, Angel Baby!" Mommy Silvia guided her toward a stall draped 

with fresh pine garlands.

Angel Baby pressed her tiny nose into the fragrant greenery, breathing in the 

sharp, woodsy scent. It smelled like 2hristmas itselfNclean and fresh and magical. 

Uer tail wagged faster. She moved to the neEt stall, where cinnamonxscented canx

dles Lickered in glass jars, their sweet, spicy aroma making her snee¡e in delight.

"30uñ linda!" an elderly vendor called out, smiling down at the little pug in her 

red sweater with white snowLakes.

Angel Baby's chest pu—ed with pride. She trotted alongside Mommy Silvia 

and Susana, eEploring each new wonder. There were wooden toys painted in 

bright colors, more lights twinkling in the gathering dusk, and tables covered with 

gingerbread cookies decorated with white icing.

Then she heard itNthe sound of children laughing.

Angel Baby's ears perked up. She tugged gently on her leash, and Mommy 

Silvia followed her lead to a small clearing where several children were building 

a snowman. Their mittened hands patted snow into place while they giggled and 

called out to each other.

"Uigher! Make him taller!"


zOBPzT MOYzOP TJzYPz

"We need a carrot for his nose!"

"?ook how big he's getting!"

Angel Baby sat down in the snow, watching intently. The children were bunx

dled in warm coats, their breath making little clouds in the air, but they didn't 

seem to mind the temperature at all. They were having too much fun.

One little girl with blonde braids noticed Angel Baby and gasped. "Mommy, 

look at the puppy in the sweater! She's so cute!"

Before Angel Baby knew it, three children had gathered around her, asking 

Mommy Silvia if they could pet her.

"Gently, ni4os," Mommy Silvia said, nodding her approval.

Soft hands stroked Angel Baby's head and back, careful Rngers touching her 

sweater's fu¡¡y yarn. The children cooed and giggled, and Angel Baby's tail bex

came a blur of happiness.

"She's so warm!" the blonde girl said. "Uer sweater is beautiful!"

"2an she play with us-" a boy with freckles asked hopefully.

Mommy Silvia smiled. "Qust for a little bit. Angel Baby isn't used to long 

playtimes in the snow."

But as Angel Baby watched the children return to their snowman, something 

began to stir in her little heart. Jsually, when winter came and the temperature 

dropped, her outdoor time became shorter and shorter. Mommy Silvia would 

bundle her in blankets and keep her in the stroller, worried she'd get too cold. 

Their walks would be 8uickNjust around the block and back inside to the warm 

house.

But today felt di—erent.

Angel Baby stood up and took a few playful steps toward the snowman, her 

paws leaving tiny prints in the white powder. She wasn't shivering. She wasn't 

uncomfortable. She was actually enjoying herself.

"Mira, Silvia," Susana said softly, pulling out her phone to take a picture. "She's 

really enjoying herself."

"I've never seen her so active in the winter," Mommy Silvia agreed, her voice full 

of wonder.

Angel Baby circled back to them, her tail still wagging, her eyes bright with 

eEcitement. She looked up at the market stretching before themNso many more 

stalls to eEplore, so many more adventures to have.

"Should we see what else we can Rnd-" Mommy Silvia asked, and Angel Baby 

yipped in agreement, already pulling toward the neEt row of stalls where she could 

see colorful ornaments hanging from ribbons and smell something deliciously 

sweet baking nearby.

They continued walking deeper into the market, and soon the pathway opened 

up into an even larger area where Angel Baby could see more people gathering 

ahead. Uer curiosity grew with every step.

The heart of the holiday market opened up before them like a storybook 

illustration come to life. Angel Baby's paws clicked against the cobblestones as 

Mommy Silvia guided her into the bustling central s8uare, where a magniRcent 

2hristmas tree towered overhead, its branches heavy with twinkling lights and 

shimmering ornaments.

"Oh, look!" Susana pointed toward a nearby bench. "That puppy has a sweater 


Angel Baby's ears perked up. She turned to see a small terrier prancing beside 

an elderly gentleman, its red plaid jacket buttoned snugly across its chest. The 

terrier's tail wagged with such enthusiasm that its whole body wiggled, completely 

unbothered by its festive attire.

The terrier noticed Angel Baby and bounded over, its owner chuckling and 

following along. Angel Baby sni—ed the new friend cautiously, then her tail began 

to wag too. The terrier yipped happily, as if to say, *We match! We're both ready 

for winter adventures!*

"Cour little one is precious," the gentleman said to Mommy Silvia, nodding at 

Angel Baby's red sweater with white snowLakes. "Smart to keep them warm on a 

day like this."

Before Mommy Silvia could respond, a woman approached carrying a Lu—y 

Dersian cat in her arms. The cat wore an elegant creamxcolored knitted sweater 

1H

with tiny pearl buttons, and despite its typically aloof feline eEpression, it seemed 

perfectly content nestled against its owner's coat.

"What a gathering of fashionable friends!" the woman laughed, pausing to 

admire the growing group. "Mittens usually hates going out in winter, but ever 

since I got her this sweater, she actually purrs when I bring out her carrier."

Angel Baby looked from the terrier to the cat, then down at her own red sweater 

with white snowLakes. Uer chest swelled with an unfamiliar but wonderful feelx

ing. She wasn't strange or sillyNshe was part of something special. All around the 

market, she began to notice other pets bundled in coats and sweaters5 a dachshund 

in a green 8uilted vest, a poodle wearing a striped turtleneck, even a small rabbit 

in a tiny red cape peeking out from a child's arms.

"See, Angel Baby-" Susana knelt down and stroked her soft fur. "Cou're not the 

only one. All the smart pets wear sweaters in winter!"

The terrier's owner reached into his pocket and pulled out a small treat. "May 

I-" he asked, and at Mommy Silvia's nod, o—ered it to Angel Baby. She accepted 

it delicately, her tail wagging faster now.

"She's really coming out of her shell," Mommy Silvia observed, warmth Rlling 

her voice. "This morning she acted like the sweater was a punishment."

"They always do at Rrst," the cat owner said knowingly. "But once they reali¡e 

it means more time outside, more eEploring, more treats and attention at places 

like thisNwell, they change their tune 8uickly enough."

Angel Baby sat up a little straighter, her pink tongue lolling out in a happy 

smile. The terrier playfully bowed, front paws stretched forward in an invitation 

to play. Angel Baby responded with a gentle play bow of her own, and for a 

moment, the two dogs circled each other in the universal dance of new friendship, 

their sweaters bright spots of color against the winterxwhite backdrop.

A group of children passed by, pointing and giggling at the collection of 

dressedxup pets. The attention felt delightfulNadmiring and inclusive.

"They're like little winter princesses and princes!" one child eEclaimed.

Susana beamed with pride. "That's my Angel Baby," she said, giving her a gentle 

pat. "The prettiest princess at the market."

As the terrier and its owner said their goodbyes and moved toward the hot 

chocolate stand, and the cat lady headed o— to browse the handmade ornaments, 

Angel Baby looked up at Mommy Silvia with bright, trusting eyes. The sweater 

no longer felt 8uite so strange. It felt like something that connected her to other 

pets, other adventures, other wonderful eEperiences.

"zeady to see more-" Mommy Silvia asked, adjusting the leash with one hand 

while Susana slipped her small hand into her mother's other one.

Angel Baby barked once, clear and certain, and stepped forward eagerly. The 

market stretched out before them, full of wonders still to discover.

7elicate snowLakes continued to drift down like tiny feathers from heaven, 

landing softly on Angel Baby's red sweater with white snowLakes before melting 

into tiny sparkles. She stood in a small patch of fresh snow near the gingerbread 

stall, her paws sinking just slightly into the powdery white surface.

"?ook at her, Mommy!" Susana laughed, pointing at Angel Baby, who was 

tentatively patting at the snow with one paw. "She's discovering winter!"

Mommy Silvia glanced over from eEamining a display of handmade ornaments, 

her face lighting up with delight. "Go ahead, Angel Baby! It's okay!"

Pncouraged, Angel Baby took a few bouncing steps through the snow. It 

crunched beneath her pawsNcold but not uncomfortable. She could feel the chill 

against her paws, but her body stayed wonderfully warm beneath the soft sweater. 

She spun in a little circle, watching the snowLakes swirl around her.

A group of children nearby were building a tiny snowman, their mittened 

hands packing snow together. Their laughter rang out like bells, and Angel Baby 

trotted closer to watch, her tail wagging with curiosity.

"2an we pet your dog-" one little girl asked, her cheeks rosy from the cold.

"Of course!" Susana said warmly. "Uer name is Angel Baby."

The children gathered around, their gentle hands stroking Angel Baby's head 

and back. "She's so warm!" one boy eEclaimed. "And her sweater is so pretty!"

Angel Baby sat proudly, soaking in the attention and the moment. She looked 

up at the falling snow, then down at her red sweater with white snowLakes, then 

16

out at the winter wonderland surrounding her. Something clicked in her little 

heartNa sudden, profound understanding.

Without this sweater, she would be shivering right now. Without it, Mommy 

Silvia would have kept her in the stroller, covered with blankets. Without it, she'd 

be watching this magical scene from behind a plastic shield instead of being part 

of it, touching the snow, meeting new friends, eEploring the pinexscented market, 

feeling the winter air on her face while staying co¡y and warm.

The sweater wasn't keeping her from having fun.

The sweater was her ticket to the fun.

It meant longer walks, more adventures, and precious time with her family in 

this sparkling winter world.

Angel Baby looked up at Mommy Silvia with eyes full of newfound apprecix

ation. She gave a happy little bark and wagged her tail so hard her whole body 

wiggled.

"I think someone's having the time of her life," Mommy Silvia said softly, 

kneeling down to adjust Angel Baby's sweater and plant a kiss on her fu¡¡y head. 

"My beautiful, warm, happy girl."

Angel Baby licked her mommy's hand, then bounded back into the snow for 

one more playful romp before they continued eEploring.

(cid:72)or the Rrst time since putting on the sweater that morning, Angel Baby wasn't 

just tolerating itNshe was grateful for it. And that made all the di—erence in the 

world.

The winter sun was beginning to dip lower in the sky, painting the market in 

shades of pink and gold. Angel Baby settled into her familiar stroller, her tiny body 

pleasantly tired from all the eEploring and playing.

"Time to head home, my sweet girl," Mommy Silvia said, tucking a soft blanket 

around Angel Baby's legs. "What a wonderful afternoon we've had!"

Susana knelt down beside the stroller, her cheeks rosy from the cold. "?ook at 

you, Angel Baby! Cou have snowLakes on your sweater!" She gently brushed a few 

delicate Lakes from the red knit fabric, but more immediately took their place, 

creating a sparkling pattern across Angel Baby's shoulders.

Angel Baby looked down at her sweaterNtruly looked at itNfor perhaps 

the Rrst time since they'd arrived at the market. The soft red yarn with white 

snowLakes was dusted with real snowLakes that caught the fading sunlight like 

diamonds. The white trim around her neck seemed to glow in the winter light. 

She remembered how she'd felt that morning, wiggling and whining as Mommy 

Silvia had dressed her.

Uow silly she'd been.

"She looks so proud," Susana observed, smiling at how Angel Baby sat with her 

head held high, her dark eyes bright and alert. "?ike she knows she's the prettiest 

puppy at the whole market."

Mommy Silvia laughed, pushing the stroller forward as they began their jourx

ney home. "She does look rather pleased with herself, doesn't she-"

Angel Baby watched the holiday market grow smaller behind them. The twinx

kling lights were just beginning to shine brighter as the daylight faded. (cid:72)amilies 

were gathering their shopping bags and bundling their children into strollers and 

wagons. Other dogs, also wearing their winter coats and sweaters, walked beside 

their owners, their tails wagging contentedly.

A soft, cold bree¡e whispered through the market, and Angel Baby instinctively 

snuggled deeper into her sweater. The warmth wrapped around her like a hug, 

keeping the chill away. She could still feel the gentle weight of the fabric against 

her black fur, but now it felt di—erent. It didn't feel restrictive or uncomfortable. 

It felt like protection. ?ike love. ?ike her family's way of making sure she could 

be part of every adventure, no matter how cold it got outside.

"I think someone's Rnally made peace with her winter wardrobe," Mommy 

Silvia said to Susana, noticing how Angel Baby had curled into the sweater rather 

than trying to scratch at it.

Susana reached over to stroke Angel Baby's head. "Cou understand now, don't 

you, little one- The sweater isn't to bother you. It's so you can come with us 

everywhere, even when it's cold and snowy."

Angel Baby's curly tail gave a small, contented wag. Ces, she understood now. 

She understood perfectly.

As they walked past the last row of market stalls, Angel Baby caught sight of her 

reLection in a shop window. There she wasNa small black pug in a red sweater 

with white snowLakes, sitting regally in her stroller, snowLakes glittering on her 

coat like stars. She looked warm. She looked happy. She looked like she belonged 

in this winter wonderland.

More than that, she looked like she was eEactly where she was meant to be5 with 

her family, ready for whatever adventures came neEt.

"YeEt weekend, there's supposed to be a treexlighting ceremony in the town 

s8uare," Mommy Silvia mentioned as they turned toward home. "Would you like 

to go, Susana- We could bring Angel Baby again."

"Ces! And maybe we can get her that matching scarf we saw at the last stall!"

Angel Baby's ears perked up at the eEcitement in Susana's voice. Another outx

ing- More winter adventures- More time eEploring the magical world outside-

And if a matching scarf meant she could stay warm even longer, well... maybe 

that wouldn't be so bad after all.

She snuggled deeper into her red sweater with white snowLakes, feeling the 

soft yarn against her fur, the gentle security of the fabric around her, the perfect 

warmth that kept the winter chill at bay. A tiny snowLake landed on her nose, 

and she snee¡ed delicately, making both Mommy Silvia and Susana laugh.

The market faded behind them, but the magic of the day stayed with Angel 

Baby. She had discovered something important today, something that would 

change every winter day to come.

As they headed home through the twilight, Angel Baby closed her eyes, content 

and warm, already dreaming of the neEt winter wonderland that awaited her.

All she needed was her family's love and her co¡y red sweater with white 

snowLakes.

And maybe, just maybe, that matching scarf.
