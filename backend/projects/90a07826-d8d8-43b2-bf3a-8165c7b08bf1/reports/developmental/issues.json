    "description": "The narrative arc is redundant across Chapters 2 and 3. In Chapter 2 (the Mall), Angel Baby realizes the sweater keeps her warm and makes her popular. In Chapter 3 (the Market), she has the exact same realization again. This causes the middle of the book to drag as the character learns the same lesson twice.",
    "suggestion": "Differentiate the chapters by giving them unique narrative goals. For example, Chapter 2 could focus on the 'social' benefit (people admiring her), while Chapter 3 focuses on the 'functional' benefit (playing in the snow). Alternatively, combine them into one 'Grand Outing' to tighten the pacing.",

    "description": "Angel Baby's transition from 'hating the sweater' to 'accepting the sweater' happens too many times. She resolves to be grumpy, then immediately feels warm and happy, then resolves to be grumpy again. This 'yo-yo' effect makes the character's internal growth feel inconsistent.",
