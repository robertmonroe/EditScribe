    "description": "Inconsistent narrative voice and character naming. The text shifts from standard English in Chapter 1 to a corrupted character set in Chapter 2, changing 'Mommy Silvia' to 'Souuy Til.ia' and 'Susana' to 'T,sana.' This destroys the established authorial voice and reader immersion.",

    "original_text": "The sweater unfurled like a tiny banner of doom",
    "description": "Jarring tone shift. The manuscript establishes a 'cozy/sweet' tone (cinnamon toast, golden stripes, velvety ears), but 'banner of doom' introduces a melodramatic/epic tone that feels out of place in a gentle children's book.",

    "description": "Weak authorial voice caused by pervasive character substitution errors (OCR/Encoding issues). Using 'Lat' for 'flat,' 'ox' for 'off,' and 'Pelds' for 'fields' makes the voice feel unpolished and distracts from the rhythmic, 'read-aloud' quality required for children's literature.",

    "description": "The repetitive use of the full descriptive phrase 'red sweater with white snowflakes' (appearing nearly ten times) creates a mechanical rhythm that weakens the authorial voice. While repetition is common in children's literature, here it feels like a placeholder rather than a stylistic choice.",

    "description": "The narrative voice shifts from a sensory, puppy-centric perspective to a highly abstract, adult-sounding metaphor ('ticket to the fun'). This breaks the 'dog's eye view' established by the smells and sounds of the market.",

    "description": "The tone becomes overly didactic (preachy). Having a character explicitly state the 'moral' of the story to the dog breaks the immersive, cozy tone of the scene and feels like the author speaking through the character.",
