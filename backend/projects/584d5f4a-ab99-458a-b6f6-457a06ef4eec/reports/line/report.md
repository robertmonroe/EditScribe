# Line Editor Report

**Total Issues Found:** 19

## CRITICAL Issues (1)

### Voice
**Location:** Chapter 2, Scene 4

**Description:** Complete break in authorial voice and POV. The narrative voice abandons the 'sentient pig' premise entirely, referring to the protagonist as a 'kid' (human), which contradicts the core premise of the 'Pig Prodigy.'

**Suggestion:** Rewrite this section to emphasize Wilbur's pig-like nature in an urban environment (e.g., 'the small pink figure' or 'the stray pig').

---

## MAJOR Issues (3)

### Voice
**Location:** Chapter 2, Scene 3

**Description:** Inconsistent narrative voice and character identity. The story establishes Wilbur as a pig with trotters/hooves, but here the voice shifts to describing him as a human with shoes.

**Suggestion:** Replace 'worn-out shoes' with 'small hooves' or 'trotters' to maintain the established animal-protagonist voice.

---

### Voice
**Location:** Chapter 3, Scene 1

**Description:** Inconsistent character voice and description. In Chapter 2, Scene 6, Pixel is explicitly described as a 'cat, lean and wiry.' Here, the voice shifts to describing Pixel as an insect with antennae.

**Suggestion:** Decide on Pixel's species and maintain consistent physical descriptions. If Pixel is a cat, replace 'antennae' and 'buzzing' with feline traits like 'whiskers' and 'purring.'

---

### Voice
**Location:** Paragraphs 6 and 7

**Description:** Inconsistent narrative voice and redundancy. The narrative 'stutters' by describing McGregor's entrance and the crowd's reaction twice in two consecutive paragraphs as if the first didn't happen.

**Suggestion:** Merge these paragraphs into a single cohesive action. Choose one description of his arrival to maintain narrative momentum.

---

## MINOR Issues (13)

### Voice
**Location:** Chapter 2, Scene 6

**Description:** Jarring tone shift. The manuscript generally maintains a whimsical, YA fable tone. Introducing the 'smell of blood' in a scene about a public chess park feels unnecessarily gritty and out of sync with the established atmosphere.

**Suggestion:** Change the sensory detail to something more aligned with the setting, such as the 'scent of old wood' or 'the sharp tang of ozone.'

---

### Voice
**Location:** Chapter 1, Scene 3

**Description:** Tone inconsistency regarding the 'rules' of the world. The story starts as a grounded animal fable, but a pig planning to use a shovel shifts the tone toward a cartoonish/slapstick voice that isn't supported by the earlier, more poetic descriptions.

**Suggestion:** Change the escape method to something a pig could realistically achieve, such as rooting under a fence or using his snout to lift a latch.

---

### Voice
**Location:** Chapter 3, Scene 6

**Description:** Inconsistent narrative voice regarding the genre. The story shifts from a standard animal fable to a magical realism/sci-fi tone with the introduction of 'sparks' and 'antennae' without prior setup.

**Suggestion:** If Pixel has magical properties, introduce them earlier. Otherwise, remove the 'sparks' to keep the tone consistent with the rest of the manuscript.

---

### Voice
**Location:** Paragraph 8

**Description:** POV slip and shift to an omniscient authorial voice. The narrative moves from Wilbur's internal focus to an external, summary-style commentary on Boris's status.

**Suggestion:** Describe Boris's frustration through Wilbur's eyes to maintain third-person limited POV (e.g., 'Wilbur saw the twitch in Boris's jaw').

---

### Voice
**Location:** Paragraph 9

**Description:** Inconsistent character voice. It is unclear if Wilbur is physically speaking English or if this is a 'translated' squeal. This creates confusion about the level of anthropomorphism in the story's world.

**Suggestion:** Clarify the communication method. If Wilbur cannot speak, use: 'Wilbur let out an urgent squeal that Pixel immediately understood as a command to distract.'

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 1

**Description:** Sentence fragment and unclear syntax; appears to be a typo or missing the subject.

**Suggestion:** Boris paused, stroking his beard.

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 2

**Description:** Confusing logic; one usually 'takes bait' by accepting a sacrifice, rather than 'sacrificing' their own piece to take it.

**Suggestion:** Boris, seeing a potential advantage, moved to capture Wilbur's piece, unaware he was falling for a trap.

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 5

**Description:** Clunky syntax with a redundant 'it' following the opening phrase.

**Suggestion:** The open file exposed a direct path to the King!

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 5

**Description:** Repetitive sentence pattern and word choice ('the file' used three times in three sentences).

**Suggestion:** A hush fell over the spectators as they realized the gravity of the move.

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 7

**Description:** Clunky transition and repetitive use of 'crowd' from the previous sentence.

**Suggestion:** As the spectators scrambled out of his way, the commotion of the match led McGregor's eyes straight to Wilbur.

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 10

**Description:** Clunky sentence structure with multiple trailing participle phrases ('disrupting', 'causing').

**Suggestion:** Pixel, still on Wilbur's head, emitted a high-pitched screech that disrupted McGregor's hearing aid and triggered a wave of painful feedback.

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 14

**Description:** Confusing placement and non-sequitur; contradicts the previous paragraph stating they had already disappeared into the crowd.

**Suggestion:** [Remove this sentence or move it to the description of their escape.]

---

### Syntax
**Location:** Paragraph 16

**Description:** Weak passive phrasing and clunky transition.

**Suggestion:** McGregor shook his fist until the pair vanished into the distance.
