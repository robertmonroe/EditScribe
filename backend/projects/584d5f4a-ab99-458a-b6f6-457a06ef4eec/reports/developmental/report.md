## MAJOR Issues (6)

### Plot
**Location:** Chapter 2, Scene 6 vs Chapter 3, Scene 1

**Description:** Major character inconsistency: Pixel is introduced as a stray cat in Chapter 2, but in Chapter 3, she is described as having antennae, chirping, and being small enough to sit on a pig's head, implying she is now an insect or a tiny alien creature.

**Suggestion:** Decide on Pixel's species and physical attributes and maintain consistency throughout the manuscript.

### Character Arc
**Location:** Chapter 3

**Description:** The protagonist lacks agency. Wilbur does not actually learn or play chess; he simply follows the literal instructions of Pixel. This prevents Wilbur from having a meaningful growth arc as a 'prodigy' because he is essentially a puppet.

**Suggestion:** Have Pixel teach Wilbur the logic behind the game earlier, but allow Wilbur to make the critical winning moves himself based on the 'patterns' he observed in Chapter 1.

---

### Plot
**Location:** Chapter 2, Scene 2

**Description:** Logic gap/Continuity: Wilbur is a pig who escapes a farm pen in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, he is suddenly wearing 'patched-up overalls' and later a 'denim jacket' with no explanation of how a pig acquired or donned human clothing.

**Suggestion:** Either remove the clothing descriptions or add a scene where Wilbur finds and struggles to put on clothes to hide his identity.

---

### Plot
**Location:** Chapter 1, Scene 3

**Description:** Logic gap: Wilbur identifies a shadow pattern as a 'chessboard' and knows the word 'checkmate' before he has ever seen the game, heard the word, or left the isolated farm. There is no established source for this specialized knowledge.

**Suggestion:** Show Wilbur seeing a chess set in the Farmer's house through a window or hearing a radio broadcast to justify his knowledge of the terminology.

---

### Plot
**Location:** Chapter 3, Scene 2

**Description:** Physical logic gap: A pig's cloven hooves are anatomically incapable of the fine motor skills required to pick up, move, and 'meticulously place' small chess pieces on a standard board without knocking over other pieces.

**Suggestion:** Address the physical challenge of the game. Perhaps Wilbur uses his snout, or the park uses a 'giant' chess set, or Pixel assists physically.

---

### Pacing
**Location:** Chapter 3

**Description:** The escalation from Wilbur's first game to beating a world-renowned Grandmaster (Boris Volkov) happens almost instantaneously. There is no 'middle' to the story where Wilbur struggles, learns, or faces setbacks in the city.

**Suggestion:** Expand the second act. Wilbur should face several low-stakes matches and perhaps a loss before facing a Grandmaster.
